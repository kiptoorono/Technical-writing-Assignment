<h1> Analysis of Global CO₂ Emissions  </h1>

<h2>   Objective  </h2>
The goals of this project is to

   - Identify the trends and patterns in CO₂ emissions over the last 10 years and identify 
   - Identify key insights that could inform policy decisions or corporate sustainability efforts.
   - Develop insights to inform strategies for adapting to the effects of climate change i.e rise in sea level.
   - Track CO₂ emissions to understand effects of human activities on the environment

<h2> Data Set </h2>

The data used in this analysis included annual CO₂ emissions from the year 2013 to 2023  for 190 countries. The data was sourced from the Global Carbon Project(GCD), It covers fossil CO₂ emissions, per capita estimates and includes oficial reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),national official statistical agencies, CDIAC-FF, Energy Institute, and many others
<h2> Key Findings </h2>
  
   1.   <h3>Continued Increase in Global Emissions</h3>

Total global CO2 emissions increased by 3.1 billion metric tons (11.4%) between 2010 and 2020, reaching a new high of 36.7 billion tons in 2019.However, emissions growth has slowed in recent years, rising just 0.5% from 2018 to 2020 compared to 3.1% annual growth from 2010-2015.
From 2013 to 2024, global CO₂ emissions trends show contrasting patterns across regions. Countries like China and India exhibit steady growth in emissions, driven by rapid industrialization and rising energy demands. In contrast, regions like the EU-28 and the United States have stabilized or slightly reduced emissions, reflecting efforts in policy-driven sustainability and green technology adoption. These trends underscore the challenge of achieving global emissions reduction targets, especially with rising contributions from developing economies.

  1.  <h3> Top Emitters </h3>

China, the world's largest CO₂ emitter, has increased its CO₂ output by approximately 1.5 billion tonnes (12.1%) since 2010, although its share of global emissions remains stable at around 28%. The United States, the second-largest emitter, reduced its emissions by 0.8 billion tonnes (-12.5%) due to a shift away from coal power. India, the third-largest emitter, saw a 1 billion tonne (32.8%) increase, reflecting rapid economic growth and expanding energy demands. Russia, the fourth-largest emitter, maintained relatively stable emissions over the last decade, driven by its dependence on fossil fuel exports. The EU-28 rounds out the top five, with emissions declining by 0.5 billion tonnes (-10%) as renewable energy adoption increased.

<h2>Implications for Policy and Corporate Action</h2>
The continued growth in global CO2 emissions, despite some progress, indicates the need for accelerated action to meet international climate goals. Key implications include:

 -  Corporations, particularly in high-impact sectors, can reduce emissions by adopting green technology and  transparent reporting on emissions
 -  There need for policies that incentivize renewable energy and enforce corporate environmental accountability. Governments can support this through subsidies, tax benefits, and stricter emissions standards
 -  Companies should prioritize setting science-based emissions reduction targets and implementing comprehensive decarbonization strategies to align with a net-zero future.
 -  Ongoing tracking and reporting of emissions data at national and corporate levels should be transparent and accurate to drive accountability and progress.

 <h2> Conclusion</h2>
Reducing CO₂ emissions demands coordinated efforts from governments and corporations. Policies promoting renewable energy and corporate green initiatives will be pivotal in mitigating environmental impact and steering towards sustainable practices globally.
